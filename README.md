# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and it can be challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.
# Overview
This project aims to construct a machine learning model and implement it as a user-friendly online application in order to provide accurate predictions about the resale values of apartments in Singapore. This prediction model will be based on past transactions involving resale flats, and its goal is to aid both future buyers and sellers in evaluating the worth of a flat after it has been previously resold. 

Resale prices are influenced by a wide variety of criteria, including location, the kind of apartment, the total square footage, and the length of the lease. The provision of customers with an expected resale price based on these criteria is one of the ways in which a predictive model may assist in the overcoming of these obstacles.
# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

# Work Flow
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and transform categorical variables into a suitable format for model training.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of data, identify important features, and detect any patterns or correlations that might help in prediction.
3. Model Development: Train various classification models to predict the target variable, including but not limited to Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. Select the best-performing model for deployment.
5. Predictions: Provide insights based on model outcomes and suggest potential actions for managing customer defaults.
# Conclusion
The successful implementation of this project will create a valuable resource for the Singaporean real estate market, bridging the gap between raw data and practical, user-friendly solutions for price estimation,This tool will enhance market transparency, helping buyers make competitive offers and sellers set realistic prices, ultimately facilitating smoother and more efficient property transactions.
